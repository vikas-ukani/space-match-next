                            <p className="text-dark-grey">One major consideration is foot traffic. Is the neighborhood or street you're considering a high-traffic area? Are there plenty of people walking by the location you're scouting-and, most importantly, are those people your target customers?</p><br />
                            <p className="text-dark-grey">Nearby retailers and events occuring in the vicinity are other important considerations. Look to see if surrounding retail stores are complementary or competitive to what you're offering. Complementary is good, but you may want to steer clear of direct competitors.</p><br />
                            <p className="text-dark-grey">When established shops feel threatened by competing stores, you lose out on making a potential ally. Take the time to introduce yourself and establish a rapport with other shop owners in the area. From them, you can glean valuable information on what makes your shared target demographic tick.</p>
